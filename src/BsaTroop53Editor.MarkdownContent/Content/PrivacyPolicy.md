## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Access Logs

We do keep access logs.
This includes the IP address and user agent of who accessed the website.
You can not opt-out of this.
Access logs are kept for 5 days before being purged.

An example entry of the access log, where x.x.x.x is the IP address:

```
x.x.x.x - - [28/Dec/2020:12:46:09 -0800] "GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1" 404 4394 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:84.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/84.0"
```

### Cookies

This website does not produce any additional cookies.
Any embeded content, however, might.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.).
Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

We don't currently collect analytics.
However, embedded content from other sites (e.g. YouTube videos or Disqus) might for their own purposes.

### How long we retain your data

Access logs are kept for 5 days before being purged.  No other data is collected.

### What rights you have over your data

We don't collect data that can be tied to an individual.
The closest thing is the IP address in the access logs.
IP Addresses can be spoofed, or behind a NAT, so we most likely couldn't tie it to a specific individual even if we tried.

### Where we send your data

All information inserted to the form do not get transmitted anywhere, everything stays on the client's web browser.

So, no data is sent anywhere.
