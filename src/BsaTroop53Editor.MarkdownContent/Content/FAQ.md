## Frequency Asked Questions

### An event took place over multiple days, which should I put as the "Post Date"?

That is mostly up to you, the author of the post.  But, here are some recommendations:

* If the event is a three day/two night event, put the second day's date, as that's usually the longest day of the event.
* If the event has photos associated with it, pick the date where the photos were taken.
* If the event had something significant happen on a particular day (e.g. a major hike or family day at summer camp), pick that day.
* If the event the post is covering has a lot going on, consider breaking it up into multiple posts; with one post per day.

### I don't know what the date of an event is?

* Give it your best guess, and check the "This date is an estimate" checkbox.  When the post goes live, it will say the date is an estimate.

### What is "Markdown"?

Markdown is a common way to provide formatting for text that eventually gets posted to the web.  Markdown eventually gets converted to html.

See this Wikipedia page for more information about Markdown: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

### What is "alt text"?

Alternative text, or [alt attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute) is the text displayed if an image is no longer available (e.g. it accidentally got deleted).

Alt text is also used with screen readers.  If a viewer of a website has trouble seeing, a screen reader will use the alt text to describe what a photo is.

When filling out the alt text field, put in how you would describe a picture to someone who can not see.

### What is the difference between "alt text" and a "caption" for a photo?

Alt text describes what happening in the photo.  A caption provides context as to what the photo is of.

For example, if a photo is of a newspaper clipping from a troop event, the caption would probably say "Newspaper clipping from The Independent showing scouts cooking."  Meanwhile, Alt text would probably include details from the article itself, such as "A black-and-white newspaper clipping that shows two scouts cooking.  The caption of the picture in the newspaper says "Scouts Seth and Rob cooking dutch oven pizzas during last weekend's camporee at Schodack Island State Park".

Another example could be a photo of two scouts setting up a tent.  A caption could say "Seth and Rob setting up their tent," while the alt text could say "Two scouts standing in a field next to a collapsed tent on the ground.  The scout on the left is holding tent poles, the scout on the right is pointing to the tent."

### What exactly are tags?

Tags, or metadata, helps describe an item and allows for it to be found again by searching.  Tags can assist in categorizing similar themes across posts (e.g. locations, or people).  It also helps search engines index the website.

If a post is about a camping trip to Camp Rotary, some good tags to add could be:

* Camp Rotary
* Summer Camp

If you need inspiration for tags to pick from, [here is a list of the website's existing tags](https://bsatroop53.com/tag/).

See this Wikipedia page for more information about tags: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)).

### Why is location only an option for Eagle Scout Projects?

To assist in creating an interactive map of Eagle Scout Projects around the community.  This doesn't really apply to other categories at the moment.

### How do I get the latitude and longitude?

There are many websites out there to get a location's latitude and longitude.  One of which is [https://www.gps-coordinates.net/](https://www.gps-coordinates.net/), where you can type in an address or pick a location on a map to get the latitude and longitude.

The values to put into the latitude and longitude fields in the form are "decimal degress", _not_ degrees, minutes, seconds.

### Is there a maximum photo size I can upload?

Uploading too big of photos _may_ cause the form to crash by having it run out of memory; so there is a built in limit of 5MB.  All photos may be shrunk down to about 1MB so they take up less server space.

### Is there a maximum amount of photos I can add to a single post?

No, but the form can only process 50 photos at a single time.  It is possible, however, that adding too many photos to a post could cause the form to crash by running out of memory.  This mainly depends on the sizes of the photos, the web browser, and how much RAM your PC has.

### Can I upload video?

Not directly, video takes up too much storage space.  Please upload to an external video hosting service such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) or [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/), and embed the video in the post.

### My post doesn't fit nicely into one of the categories

In your email, make a note of this, and suggest a new category.  If it fits the website, the new category will be added.

### Does the form save my work for me?

Not at the moment, maybe in the future.
