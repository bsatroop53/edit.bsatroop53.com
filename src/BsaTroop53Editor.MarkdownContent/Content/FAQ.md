## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I use the Post Editor or the Assorted Photos Editor?

The post editor creates an entirely new post.  The assorted photos editor appends photos to an already existing post that contains assorted photos for a specific year.

If you have a series of photos that can be categorized into a specific troop event, please use the post editor.  Please use the post editor even if there's only one photo from that event (others may have photos they wish to add later, and its easier to have it be a separate post rather than moving photos around).

The assorted photos editor should only be used for adding photos to the website that are not easily tied to a specific troop event.  This can include photos from troop meetings or a photo of a troop activity where the details about the activity are unknown or lost to time.

### An event took place over multiple days, which should I put as the "Post Date"?

That is mostly up to you, the author of the post.  But, here are some recommendations:

* If the event is a three day/two night event, put the second day's date, as that's usually the longest day of the event.
* If the event has photos associated with it, pick the date where the photos were taken.
* If the event had something significant happen on a particular day (e.g. a major hike or family day at summer camp), pick that day.
* If the event the post is covering has a lot going on, consider breaking it up into multiple posts; with one post per day.

### I don't know what the date of an event is?

* Give it your best guess, and check the "This date is an estimate" checkbox.  When the post goes live, it will say the date is an estimate.

### I'm not posting about an outing or event, what do I put as the post date?

If you're posting something such as scout skills, recipes, or anything that isn't covering an event that happened on a specific date, just use today's date to show when the post was created.

### Which category should I put my post in?

These are the current recommendations of the type of post to put in each category:

#### Outings

* Anytime the troop gets together and does something that does not fall under any other category can fall under this.
* Highway cleanups, memorial day parades, or day hikes could all fall under this.
* If there was a "generic" category, this would be the closest thing to it.

#### Recipes

* Any recipes that can be used for camping, a hike, or anything related to scouting.

#### Scout Skills

* Tips on skills a scout should know such as knot tying, first aid, etc.

#### Camping Trips

* Posts that show recent camping trips.

#### Eagle Projects

* Posts showing off a scout's Eagle project.

#### News

* Whenever something major occurs that people or the media would be interested in should go under here.  This includes, but is not limited to:
  * When a scout completes their Eagle broad of review.
  * When a scout or scouts do something unique that is newsworthy.
  * An upcoming troop event where the community is invited to.

#### Christmas Tree Sales

* Any posts relating to Troop 53's annual Christmas Tree sales at Maple Hill Trees.

### What is "Markdown"?

Markdown is a common way to provide formatting for text that eventually gets posted to the web.  Markdown eventually gets converted to html.

See this Wikipedia page for more information about Markdown: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

### What is "alt text"?

Alternative text, or [alt attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute) is the text displayed if an image is no longer available (e.g. it accidentally got deleted).

Alt text is also used with screen readers.  If a viewer of a website has trouble seeing, a screen reader will use the alt text to describe what a photo is.

When filling out the alt text field, put in how you would describe a picture to someone who can not see.

### What is the difference between "alt text" and a "caption" for a photo?

Alt text describes what happening in the photo.  A caption provides context as to what the photo is of.

For example, if a photo is of a newspaper clipping from a troop event, the caption would probably say "Newspaper clipping from The Independent showing scouts cooking."  Meanwhile, Alt text would probably include details from the article itself, such as "A black-and-white newspaper clipping that shows two scouts cooking.  The caption of the picture in the newspaper says "Scouts Seth and Rob cooking dutch oven pizzas during last weekend's camporee at Schodack Island State Park".

Another example could be a photo of two scouts setting up a tent.  A caption could say "Seth and Rob setting up their tent," while the alt text could say "Two scouts standing in a field next to a collapsed tent on the ground.  The scout on the left is holding tent poles, the scout on the right is pointing to the tent."

### What are "Editor Notes"?

These are notes targeted towards editors of the website.
These generally are not visible to visitors of the website unless they click on a button.

These notes can include:

* Information on why a date was chosen for the photo.
* Best guess at names or location of the photo.
* Source of a photo.
* Any information that an editor should be aware of before approving a post.

### What exactly are tags?

Tags, or metadata, helps describe an item and allows for it to be found again by searching.  Tags can assist in categorizing similar themes across posts (e.g. locations, or people).  It also helps search engines index the website.

If a post is about a camping trip to Camp Rotary, some good tags to add could be:

* Camp Rotary
* Summer Camp

If you need inspiration for tags to pick from, [here is a list of the website's existing tags](https://bsatroop53.com/tag/).

See this Wikipedia page for more information about tags: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)).

### Why is location only an option for Eagle Scout Projects?

To assist in creating an interactive map of Eagle Scout Projects around the community.  This doesn't really apply to other categories at the moment.

### How do I get the latitude and longitude?

There are many websites out there to get a location's latitude and longitude.  One of which is [https://www.gps-coordinates.net/](https://www.gps-coordinates.net/), where you can type in an address or pick a location on a map to get the latitude and longitude.

The values to put into the latitude and longitude fields in the form are "decimal degress", _not_ degrees, minutes, seconds.

### Is there a maximum photo size I can upload?

Uploading too big of photos _may_ cause the form to crash by having it run out of memory; so there is a built in limit of 5MB.  All photos may be shrunk down to about 1MB so they take up less server space.

### Is there a maximum amount of photos I can add to a single post?

No, but the form can only process 50 photos at a single time.  It is possible, however, that adding too many photos to a post could cause the form to crash by running out of memory.  This mainly depends on the sizes of the photos, the web browser, and how much RAM your PC has.

### My post doesn't fit nicely into one of the categories

In your email, make a note of this, and suggest a new category.  If it fits the website, the new category will be added.

### Does the form save my work for me?

Not at the moment, maybe in the future.

### Can I upload video?

Not directly, video takes up too much storage space.  Please upload to an external video hosting service such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) or [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/), and embed the video in the post.

### Can I upload a newspaper article in its entirety about the Troop?

It mainly depends on when the newspaper was published, and how it renewed its copyright (if it did so at all).

Generally speaking:

* Any article posted 1928 or earlier is in the public domain, and is free to post.
* Any article posted between 1928 and 1977 _without_ a copyright notice means it is in the public domain, and is free to post.
* Any article posted between 1928 and 1963 _with_ a copyright notice but the copyright was _not_ renewed are okay to post.
* Any article posted between 1978 and March 1, 1989 _without_ a copyright notice _and_ not registered within five years of publication are okay to post.
* Any article posted March 1, 1989 or after are covered by copyright for 95 years.  DO NOT upload or re-publish these without permission from the copyright holder unless it falls under fair use (see below), or 95 years have passed since its original publish date.
* _[More Information](https://www.legalgenealogist.com/2012/03/19/copyright-the-newspaper-article/)_

For the third and forth bullets, this website can be used to see a list of copyrights and when they got renewed: [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/cce/](http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/cce/).

For any articles still under copyright, the safest approach is to contact the copyright holder for permission.  However, if the copyright holder no longer exists (e.g. a newspaper is no longer published), or it not possible to figure out who the copyright holder is, the newspaper article could be posted under "[fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)".  There is no golden formula for what qualifies as fair use or not, as it is a case-by-case basis.

The Troop is non-profit, articles are usually fact-based (facts can not be copyrighted), and re-posting a single article from a newspaper probably won't impact a newspaper's bottom line.  All of these factors can make an argument that it is fair use.  However, re-posting a copyrighted work in its entirety may not fall under fair-use.

With that in mind, the guidance is as follows for newspaper articles posted after March 1, 1989:

* If the original newspaper article is still accessible online from the original publisher, seek permission.  It could be argued the Troop website re-posting an article in its entirety could take away clicks from the newspaper's website and decrease their ad revenue, violating fair use.
* If the original newspaper article is not accessible online (as in, it was only printed in a physical newspaper), and it is mostly made up of facts, it is _probably_ safe to re-post.  Re-posting a decades old article probably isn't going to impact a newspaper's bottom line.  However, if the newspaper that originally published the article still exists, it is recommended to seek permission anyways.
* If the original newspaper article is not made up of mostly facts, such as an opinion piece, seek permission first.  While facts are not copyrightable, opinions most certainly are.

If permission gets denied, there's nothing to do other than hold on to the article, pass it down through the generations, and wait 95 years after the publish date to post it.
